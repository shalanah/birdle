# Birdle

Use five letter words to guess the bird of the day.

## Fun firsts

- First time using VITE, React + TS (together), and finally got around to using SVGR for the first time

## Possible future improvements

- Add tracking daily progress
- Build out rest of UI around game (tracking, streaks, about, github link etc)
- Update color scheme to be more bird friendly

## Screenshots

<div>
<img style="float: left" src="/screenshots/1.png" width="250" height="414" />
<img style="float: left" src="/screenshots/2.png" width="250" height="414" />
<img style="float: left" src="/screenshots/3.png" width="250" height="414" />
<img style="float: left" src="/screenshots/4.png" width="250" height="414" />
<img style="float: left" src="/screenshots/5.png" width="250" height="414" />
</div>

## Credits

Used Shutterstock photos for the bird images - I had some leftover credits from another side project and used to download.

## Prompt

Your challenge is to build a wordle clone! If you haven't played, you can find the game here: https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html.

You can implement as close to the real UI as you want (preferably adding your own signature), but the key is to maintain the core functionality:
  1) There must be one word per day.
  2) A user can only guess six times, after which the word will be revealed.
  3) Letters within a guess should be distinctly highlighted after a guess based on these groups: letters matching exact position in the target word, letters included in the target word (but in incorrect position) and letters not included in the target word.
