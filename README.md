# Birdle

Use five letter words to guess the bird of the day. (for-fun wordle clone go to https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html to play the real game)

## Fun firsts

- First time using VITE, React + TS (together), and finally got around to using SVGR for the first time

## Possible future improvements

- Add to localstorage with track daily progress
- Build out rest of UI around game (tracking, streaks, about, github link etc)
- Make responsive
- Update color scheme to be more bird friendly
